**Task:** Assume you start with no labeled data. Build a classifier that achieves 90% accuracy on the test set using the smallest number of queries to a simulated human annotator database which contains labeled data.

**Dataset:** [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

# Setup
```
conda create -n jax-fashion python=3.9
conda activate jax-fashion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Strategy
1. Select a subset of train data to be labeled at initialization
   1. Baseline: random sampling, n=100
   2. v1: Clustering & choosing centroids?
2. Train classifier on labeled subset
3. Predict on remaining points in train data
4. Predict on held-out test set 
5. Choose unlabeled points which are added to labeled subset
   1. Baseline: random sampling, n=50
   2. v1: use a scoring metric to determine which points should be labeled first
6. Repeat 2 -> 5 until 90% accuracy on held-out test set
